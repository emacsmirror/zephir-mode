A [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] major mode for editing [[https://zephir-lang.com/][Zephir]] code. Provides syntax highlighting,
indentation, movement, navigation support and Imenu.

Zephir is a high level programming language that eases the creation and
maintainability of extensions for PHP. Zephir extensions are exported to C code
that can be compiled and optimized by major C compilers such as
gcc/clang/vc++. Functionality is exposed to the PHP language.

** Features

- Basic syntax definition
- Indentation of expressions and statements
- Syntax highlighting
- Movement
- Imenu

** Installation

Known to work with GNU Emacs 24.3 and later.  Zephir Mode may work with older
versions of Emacs, or with other flavors of Emacs (e.g. XEmacs) but this is
/not/ guaranteed.  Bug reports for problems related to using Zephir Mode with
older versions of Emacs will most like not be addressed.

The master of all the material is the Git repository at
https://github.com/zephir-lang/zephir-mode.

NOTE: The ~master~ branch will always contain the latest unstable version.
If you wish to check older versions or formal, tagged release, please switch
to the relevant [[https://github.com/zephir-lang/zephir-mode/tags][tag]].

The recommended way is to use, [[https://stable.melpa.org/][MELPA Stable]] or [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]]. If either is in your
=package-archives=, do:

#+begin_src
M-x package-install RET zephir-mode RET
#+end_src

To learn on how to use any other installation methods refer to relevant
documentation.
